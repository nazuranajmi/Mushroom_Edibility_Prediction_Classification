# Mushroom Edibility Prediction

## Description

In this project, we examine mushroom data and create machine learning algorithms to determine whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous based on its characteristics, such as cap shape, cap color, gill color, and more, using different classifiers.

## Dataset

This dataset includes descriptions of mushrooms in terms of their physical characteristics. They are classified as either poisonous or edible. The dataset comprises hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family. Each species is identified as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility and not recommended. This latter class was combined with the poisonous one. The guide clearly states that there is no simple rule for determining the edibility of a mushroom; no rule like "leaflets three, let it be" for Poisonous Oak and Ivy.

## Project Overview

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform an initial investigation of the data to discover patterns, spot anomalies, and check assumptions with statistical graphics and other data visualization methods.
- **Feature Engineering**: Process and prepare the data for model training, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
- **Model Training**: Train various classification algorithms to predict the edibility of mushrooms. The classifiers include:
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machine
  - k-Nearest Neighbors
  - Logistic Regression
  - XGBoost
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess the performance of the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
